This is a project that I have done with the video game series called Pokemon.

I have divided the project into smaller parts such as Pokemon games, moves, and species. These parts pertain to the various aspects of the game series. 

Please read the summaries in the summaries folder to look at the analysis that I have done by forming questions and providing answers. 

It also summarizes the series and provides an overview of the Pokemon game series to those who are not familiar with it.

# Pokemon Games

The Pokemon games folder has an Excel spreadsheet of all the years, consoles, sales, and titles of the games in the series along with the SQL code that I have created with it.

Through SQL I have found the titles with the most sales and also used SQL queries to find out which consoles belong to which titles.

I have also uploaded a Tableau data visualizations that shows the graphs associated with the data of the games in the series.

# Pokemon Moves

The Pokemon moves folder has all of the files associated with the different moves of the Pokemon as well as other information such as the generation it came from, 
category, power accuracy, and the types. 

The SQL code in this part of the project provides information to show how many moves of each type are in each generation as well as other factors such as accuracy and power.

The Tableau file consists of different types of graphs that show the different categories in the Pokemon moves spreadsheet and how they are related to the generations of 
Pokemon.

# Pokemon Species

The Pokemon species folder has files associated with the different Pokemon in the series. It lists all of the Pokemon by number as well as providing their type, stats
capture rate, experience and their strengths as well as weakness against Pokemon types.

The SQL code consists of queries that give results based on Pokemon types, stats, weight, height and information on a selected random set of Pokemon.
